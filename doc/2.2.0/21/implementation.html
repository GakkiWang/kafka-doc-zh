    <h3><a id="networklayer" href="#networklayer">5.1 网络层</a></h3>
    <p>
        网络层相当于一个NIO服务器，这里不再详细描述。sendfile（零拷贝）实现是通过 <code>MessageSet</code> 接口提供的 <code>writeTo</code> 方法来完成的。这允许 file-backed 消息集使用更高效的 <code>transferTo</code> 实现，而不是进程内缓冲写入。线程模型（Reactor模式）是单个接受器线程和 <i>N</i> 个处理器线程，每个处理器线程处理固定数量的连接。这个设计已经过<a href="http://sna-projects.com/blog/2009/08/introducing-the-nio-socketserver-implementation">此处</a>全面测试，发现该设计能简单实施和具有快速性能。该协议非常简洁，以便将来使用其他语言实现客户端。
    </p>
    <h3><a id="messages" href="#messages">5.2 消息</a></h3>
    <p>
    消息由可变长度的header，可变长度的不透明字节数组 key 和可变长度的不透明字节数组 value 组成。header的格式将在下一节中介绍。
    让 key 和 value 不透明是正确的决定：目前在序列化库上取得了很大进展，任何特定的选择都不太适合所有使用场景。毋庸置疑，使用 Kafka 的特定应用程序可能会强制使用特定的序列化类型作为其使用的一部分。<code> RecordBatch </code>接口只是消息的迭代器，具有批量读取和写入NIO <code> Channel </code>的专用方法。
    </p>

    <h3><a id="messageformat" href="#messageformat">5.3 消息格式</a></h3>
    <p>
        消息（即 Records ）始终是批量写入。record batch 是批量消息的技术术语,它包含一条或多条 records。在不良情况下, record batch 只包含一条 record。
        Record batches 和 records 都有自己的 headers。 每种格式如下所述。</p>

    <h4><a id="recordbatch" href="#recordbatch">5.3.1 Record Batch</a></h4>
	<p> 以下是RecordBatch的磁盘格式。</p>
	<p><pre class="brush: java;">
		baseOffset: int64
		batchLength: int32
		partitionLeaderEpoch: int32
		magic: int8 (current magic value is 2)
		crc: int32
		attributes: int16
			bit 0~2:
				0: no compression
				1: gzip
				2: snappy
				3: lz4
				4: zstd
			bit 3: timestampType
			bit 4: isTransactional (0 means not transactional)
			bit 5: isControlBatch (0 means not a control batch)
			bit 6~15: unused
		lastOffsetDelta: int32
		firstTimestamp: int64
		maxTimestamp: int64
		producerId: int64
		producerEpoch: int16
		baseSequence: int32
		records: [Record]
	</pre></p>
    <p> 请注意，启用压缩后，被压缩的记录数据将在记录数量的计数后直接序列化。</p>

    <p> CRC覆盖从 attributes 到批处理结束的数据（即CRC之后的所有字节）。它位于 magic 字节之后，这意味着客户端必须在解析批处理长度和 magic 字节之间的字节之前解析 magic 字节。
        分区 leader epoch 字段不包括在 CRC 计算中，以避免当该字段分配给 broker 接收的每个批次时重新计算 CRC。CRC-32C（Castagnoli）多项式用于计算。</p>

    <p>压缩：与旧的消息格式不同，magic v2 及更高版本在清理日志时保留原始批次中的第一个和最后一个偏移/序列号。这是必需的，以便能够在重新加载日志时恢复 producer 的状态。例如，如果我们没有保留最后的序列号，那么在分区 leader 失败之后，producer 可能会看到 OutOfSequence 错误。
        必须保留基础序列号来做重复检查( broker 通过验证传入批次的第一个和最后一个序列号是否与该 producer 的最后一个序列号匹配来检查传入的重复 produce 请求)。因此,当批次中所有的记录被清理但批次数据依然保留是为了保存 producer 最后一次的序列号,日志中可能有空的数据。
        不解的是在压缩中时间戳可能不会被保留,所以如果批次中的第一条记录被压缩,时间戳也会改变。</p>

    <h5><a id="controlbatch" href="#controlbatch">5.3.1.1 控制批次</a></h5>
    <p>控制批次包含一个称为控制记录的记录。控制记录不应传递给应用程序。相反，消费者使用它们来过滤掉中止的事务性消息。</p>
    <p>  控制记录的 key 符合以下模式: </p>
    <p><pre class="brush: java">
       version: int16 (current version is 0)
       type: int16 (0 indicates an abort marker, 1 indicates a commit)
    </pre></p>
    <p>控制记录值的模式取决于类型。该值对客户端不透明。</p>

    <h4><a id="record" href="#record">5.3.2 Record</a></h4>
	<p>Record 级别的头部信息在0.11.0 版本引入。拥有 headers 的 Record 的磁盘格式如下：</p>
	<p><pre class="brush: java;">
		length: varint
		attributes: int8
			bit 0~7: unused
		timestampDelta: varint
		offsetDelta: varint
		keyLength: varint

	<p><pre class="brush: java;">
		headerKeyLength: varint
		headerKey: String
		headerValueLength: varint
		Value: byte[]
	</pre></p>
    <p>我们使用与Protobuf相同的varint编码。有关后者的更多信息，请访问<a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#varints">此处</a>。
        记录中的 header 数也被编码为varint。</p>

    <h4><a id="messageset" href="#messageset">5.3.3 旧的消息格式</a></h4>
    <p>
        在Kafka 0.11之前，消息被传输并存储在<i>Message Set</i>中。在消息集中，每条消息都有自己的元数据。
        请注意，虽然消息集表示为一个数组，但它们之前没有像协议中其他数组元素那样的int32数组大小。

    <p>
        In versions prior to Kafka 0.10, the only supported message format version (which is indicated in the magic value) was 0. Message format version 1 was introduced with timestamp support in version 0.10.
    <ul>
        <li>Similarly to version 2 above, the lowest bits of attributes represent the compression type.</li>
        <li>In version 1, the producer should always set the timestamp type bit to 0. If the topic is configured to use log append time,
            (through either broker level config log.message.timestamp.type = LogAppendTime or topic level config message.timestamp.type = LogAppendTime),
	    the broker will overwrite the timestamp type and the timestamp in the message set.</li>
        <li>The highest bits of attributes must be set to 0.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>In message format versions 0 and 1 Kafka supports recursive messages to enable compression. In this case the message's attributes must be set
      to indicate one of the compression types and the value field will contain a message set compressed with that type. We often refer
      to the nested messages as "inner messages" and the wrapping message as the "outer message." Note that the key should be null
      for the outer message and its offset will be the offset of the last inner message.
    </p>
    <p>When receiving recursive version 0 messages, the broker decompresses them and each inner message is assigned an offset individually.
      In version 1, to avoid server side re-compression, only the wrapper message will be assigned an offset. The inner messages
      will have relative offsets. The absolute offset can be computed using the offset from the outer message, which corresponds
      to the offset assigned to the last inner message.
    </p>

    <p>The crc field contains the CRC32 (and not CRC-32C) of the subsequent message bytes (i.e. from magic byte to the value).</p>

    <h3><a id="log" href="#log">5.4 Log</a></h3>
    <p>
    A log for a topic named "my_topic" with two partitions consists of two directories (namely <code>my_topic_0</code> and <code>my_topic_1</code>) populated with data files containing the messages for that topic. The format of the log files is a sequence of "log entries""; each log entry is a 4 byte integer <i>N</i> storing the message length which is followed by the <i>N</i> message bytes. Each message is uniquely identified by a 64-bit integer <i>offset</i> giving the byte position of the start of this message in the stream of all messages ever sent to that topic on that partition. The on-disk format of each message is given below. Each log file is named with the offset of the first message it contains. So the first file created will be 00000000000.kafka, and each additional file will have an integer name roughly <i>S</i> bytes from the previous file where <i>S</i> is the max log file size given in the configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
    The exact binary format for records is versioned and maintained as a standard interface so record batches can be transferred between producer, broker, and client without recopying or conversion when desirable. The previous section included details about the on-disk format of records.</p>
    </p>
   <p>
    The use of the message offset as the message id is unusual. Our original idea was to use a GUID generated by the producer, and maintain a mapping from GUID to offset on each broker. But since a consumer must maintain an ID for each server, the global uniqueness of the GUID provides no value. Furthermore, the complexity of maintaining the mapping from a random id to an offset requires a heavy weight index structure which must be synchronized with disk, essentially requiring a full persistent random-access data structure. Thus to simplify the lookup structure we decided to use a simple per-partition atomic counter which could be coupled with the partition id and node id to uniquely identify a message; this makes the lookup structure simpler, though multiple seeks per consumer request are still likely. However once we settled on a counter, the jump to directly using the offset seemed natural&mdash;both after all are monotonically increasing integers unique to a partition. Since the offset is hidden from the consumer API this decision is ultimately an implementation detail and we went with the more efficient approach.
    </p>
    <img class="centered" src="/{{version}}/images/kafka_log.png">
    <h4><a id="impl_writes" href="#impl_writes">Writes</a></h4>
    <p>
    The log allows serial appends which always go to the last file. This file is rolled over to a fresh file when it reaches a configurable size (say 1GB). The log takes two configuration parameters: <i>M</i>, which gives the number of messages to write before forcing the OS to flush the file to disk, and <i>S</i>, which gives a number of seconds after which a flush is forced. This gives a durability guarantee of losing at most <i>M</i> messages or <i>S</i> seconds of data in the event of a system crash.
    </p>
    <h4><a id="impl_reads" href="#impl_reads">Reads</a></h4>
    <p>
    Reads are done by giving the 64-bit logical offset of a message and an <i>S</i>-byte max chunk size. This will return an iterator over the messages contained in the <i>S</i>-byte buffer. <i>S</i> is intended to be larger than any single message, but in the event of an abnormally large message, the read can be retried multiple times, each time doubling the buffer size, until the message is read successfully. A maximum message and buffer size can be specified to make the server reject messages larger than some size, and to give a bound to the client on the maximum it needs to ever read to get a complete message. It is likely that the read buffer ends with a partial message, this is easily detected by the size delimiting.
    </p>
    <p>
    The actual process of reading from an offset requires first locating the log segment file in which the data is stored, calculating the file-specific offset from the global offset value, and then reading from that file offset. The search is done as a simple binary search variation against an in-memory range maintained for each file.
    </p>
    <p>
    The log provides the capability of getting the most recently written message to allow clients to start subscribing as of "right now". This is also useful in the case the consumer fails to consume its data within its SLA-specified number of days. In this case when the client attempts to consume a non-existent offset it is given an OutOfRangeException and can either reset itself or fail as appropriate to the use case.
    </p>

    <p> The following is the format of the results sent to the consumer.

    <pre class="brush: text;">
    MessageSetSend (fetch result)

    total length     : 4 bytes
    error code       : 2 bytes
    message 1        : x bytes
    ...
    message n        : x bytes
    </pre>

    <pre class="brush: text;">
    MultiMessageSetSend (multiFetch result)

    total length       : 4 bytes
    error code         : 2 bytes
    messageSetSend 1
    ...
    messageSetSend n
    </pre>
    <h4><a id="impl_deletes" href="#impl_deletes">Deletes</a></h4>
    <p>
    Data is deleted one log segment at a time. The log manager allows pluggable delete policies to choose which files are eligible for deletion. The current policy deletes any log with a modification time of more than <i>N</i> days ago, though a policy which retained the last <i>N</i> GB could also be useful. To avoid locking reads while still allowing deletes that modify the segment list we use a copy-on-write style segment list implementation that provides consistent views to allow a binary search to proceed on an immutable static snapshot view of the log segments while deletes are progressing.
    </p>
    <h4><a id="impl_guarantees" href="#impl_guarantees">Guarantees</a></h4>
    <p>
    The log provides a configuration parameter <i>M</i> which controls the maximum number of messages that are written before forcing a flush to disk. On startup a log recovery process is run that iterates over all messages in the newest log segment and verifies that each message entry is valid. A message entry is valid if the sum of its size and offset are less than the length of the file AND the CRC32 of the message payload matches the CRC stored with the message. In the event corruption is detected the log is truncated to the last valid offset.
    </p>
    <p>
    Note that two kinds of corruption must be handled: truncation in which an unwritten block is lost due to a crash, and corruption in which a nonsense block is ADDED to the file. The reason for this is that in general the OS makes no guarantee of the write order between the file inode and the actual block data so in addition to losing written data the file can gain nonsense data if the inode is updated with a new size but a crash occurs before the block containing that data is written. The CRC detects this corner case, and prevents it from corrupting the log (though the unwritten messages are, of course, lost).
    </p>

    <h3><a id="distributionimpl" href="#distributionimpl">5.5 Distribution</a></h3>
    <h4><a id="impl_offsettracking" href="#impl_offsettracking">Consumer Offset Tracking</a></h4>
    <p>
    Kafka consumer tracks the maximum offset it has consumed in each partition and has the capability to commit offsets so
        that it can resume from those offsets in the event of a restart. Kafka provides the option to store all the offsets for
        a given consumer group in a designated broker (for that group) called the group coordinator.  i.e., any consumer instance
        in that consumer group should send its offset commits and fetches to that group coordinator (broker). Consumer groups are
        assigned to coordinators based on their group names. A consumer can look up its coordinator by issuing a FindCoordinatorRequest
        to any Kafka broker and reading the FindCoordinatorResponse which will contain the coordinator details. The consumer
        can then proceed to commit or fetch offsets from the coordinator broker. In case the coordinator moves, the consumer will
        need to rediscover the coordinator. Offset commits can be done automatically or manually by consumer instance.
    </p>

    <p>
    When the group coordinator receives an OffsetCommitRequest, it appends the request to a special <a href="#compaction">compacted</a> Kafka topic named <i>__consumer_offsets</i>.
        The broker sends a successful offset commit response to the consumer only after all the replicas of the offsets topic receive the offsets.
        In case the offsets fail to replicate within a configurable timeout, the offset commit will fail and the consumer may retry the commit after backing off.
        The brokers periodically compact the offsets topic since it only needs to maintain the most recent offset commit per partition.
        The coordinator also caches the offsets in an in-memory table in order to serve offset fetches quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
    When the coordinator receives an offset fetch request, it simply returns the last committed offset vector from the offsets cache.
        In case coordinator was just started or if it just became the coordinator for a new set of consumer groups (by becoming a leader for a partition of the offsets topic),
        it may need to load the offsets topic partition into the cache. In this case, the offset fetch will fail with an
        CoordinatorLoadInProgressException and the consumer may retry the OffsetFetchRequest after backing off.
    </p>

    <h4><a id="impl_zookeeper" href="#impl_zookeeper">ZooKeeper Directories</a></h4>
    <p>
    The following gives the ZooKeeper structures and algorithms used for co-ordination between consumers and brokers.
    </p>

    <h4><a id="impl_zknotation" href="#impl_zknotation">Notation</a></h4>
    <p>
    When an element in a path is denoted [xyz], that means that the value of xyz is not fixed and there is in fact a ZooKeeper znode for each possible value of xyz. For example /topics/[topic] would be a directory named /topics containing a sub-directory for each topic name. Numerical ranges are also given such as [0...5] to indicate the subdirectories 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. An arrow -> is used to indicate the contents of a znode. For example /hello -> world would indicate a znode /hello containing the value "world".
    </p>

    <h4><a id="impl_zkbroker" href="#impl_zkbroker">Broker Node Registry</a></h4>
    <pre class="brush: json;">
    /brokers/ids/[0...N] --> {"jmx_port":...,"timestamp":...,"endpoints":[...],"host":...,"version":...,"port":...} (ephemeral node)
    </pre>
    <p>
    This is a list of all present broker nodes, each of which provides a unique logical broker id which identifies it to consumers (which must be given as part of its configuration). On startup, a broker node registers itself by creating a znode with the logical broker id under /brokers/ids. The purpose of the logical broker id is to allow a broker to be moved to a different physical machine without affecting consumers. An attempt to register a broker id that is already in use (say because two servers are configured with the same broker id) results in an error.
    </p>
    <p>
    Since the broker registers itself in ZooKeeper using ephemeral znodes, this registration is dynamic and will disappear if the broker is shutdown or dies (thus notifying consumers it is no longer available).
    </p>
    <h4><a id="impl_zktopic" href="#impl_zktopic">Broker Topic Registry</a></h4>
    <pre class="brush: json;">
    /brokers/topics/[topic]/partitions/[0...N]/state --> {"controller_epoch":...,"leader":...,"version":...,"leader_epoch":...,"isr":[...]} (ephemeral node)
    </pre>

    <p>
    Each broker registers itself under the topics it maintains and stores the number of partitions for that topic.
    </p>

    <h4><a id="impl_clusterid" href="#impl_clusterid">Cluster Id</a></h4>

    <p>
        The cluster id is a unique and immutable identifier assigned to a Kafka cluster. The cluster id can have a maximum of 22 characters and the allowed characters are defined by the regular expression [a-zA-Z0-9_\-]+, which corresponds to the characters used by the URL-safe Base64 variant with no padding. Conceptually, it is auto-generated when a cluster is started for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Implementation-wise, it is generated when a broker with version 0.10.1 or later is successfully started for the first time. The broker tries to get the cluster id from the <code>/cluster/id</code> znode during startup. If the znode does not exist, the broker generates a new cluster id and creates the znode with this cluster id.
    </p>

    <h4><a id="impl_brokerregistration" href="#impl_brokerregistration">Broker node registration</a></h4>

    <p>
    The broker nodes are basically independent, so they only publish information about what they have. When a broker joins, it registers itself under the broker node registry directory and writes information about its host name and port. The broker also register the list of existing topics and their logical partitions in the broker topic registry. New topics are registered dynamically when they are created on the broker.
    </p>
